## Description

The game Simon is a popular electronic game created by Milton Brandly (now Hasbro) in 1978. Read more about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)

Our class assignment was to replicate one of several popular games using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

## Demonstration

## List of Features / User Stories

This is a very simple game:

- The user presses start. The computer will then "flash" one of the lights and play a sound.
- The user clicks on or touches the same light, and advances to the next level, which is now two "flashes".
- The user now has to click/press two lights in the same order. This continues with one new light added each round.
- If at any point the user fails to mimic the correct order the game will play the buzzer sound and the game is over.

## List of Technologies Used

This game was built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
